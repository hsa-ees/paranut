# This is the config.mk from systems/refdesign.
# In order to reflect the default ParaNut configuration it needs to remain
# empty. You may add configuration options as listed in $(PARANUT_HOME)/config.mk
# (or config.reference.mk if working in a pn-newproject directory) to adapt 
# your ParaNut system.
