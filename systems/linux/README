Development environment: Xilinx Vivado 2017.2


Target Boards: 
  * Digilent Zybo board (Zynq Z-7010, XC7Z010) (Retired) 
    Set during build: BOARD=zybo
  * Digilent Zybo Z7-20 board (Zynq Z-7020, XC7Z020)
    Set during build: BOARD=zybo_z7020

  Note: Vivado Board Files must be installed!
   Ensure you have installed the Vivado Board Files for your target
   board. These files can be obtained from Digilent or Avnet (they call 
   it "Board Definitions") and are placed in the Vivado installation
   directory at '%Vivado-Dir/data/boards/board_files/'.


Additional hardware (optional):
  * a OpenOCD compatible JTAG debugger (see doc/paranut-manual.pdf)


Info on Vivado IP cores:
  * PARANUT: ParaNut processor 


Software / demo system usage:
  The Linux kernel and other required software components will be located in the 
  'software/' directory.
  


**************
* Quickstart *
**************
  0) For proper operation of Vivado (needed to generate an ASTERICS IP 
     core for Vivado and to build the system) make sure you source your 
     Vivado environment:
     > source <VIVADO-DIR>/settings64.sh
     
     Make sure you source the ParaNut environment prior to any action 
     in the project folder:
     > source <PARANUT-DIR>/settings.sh

  1) Build the whole system (hardware platform and Linux)
     Select your board during this step. Default is 'zybo'. 
     The software is copied from '<PARANUT-DIR>/sw'.
     Can also be changed to another software located in the same
     directory by setting the 'SOFTWARE_SRC' variable.
     This step will take some time:
     > make build 
     or e.g.
     > make build BOARD=zybo_z7020

  3) Connect your board to your computer and power on the board.
     Then upload the hardware and software to the board:
     > make run



****************
* Make Targets *
****************

  Following make targets help to build a complete system
  which is put to operation on the target board.

  * paranut_core :          Generate the ParaNut IP core for
                            Xilinx Vivado using in the 'vivado_cores'
                            directory. 

  * software:               Populate the software directory with the
                            Linux sources and more required software
                            components.
                            
  * clean-software:         Remove 
  * build_system:           Generate and build the whole demo system
                            (hardware + software) from sources.
                      NOTE: target 'paranut_core' has to be run once before!

  * run:                    Run the demo on the target board.
                      NOTE: target 'build_system' has to be run once before!

  * all / build_and_run :   The lazy target: performs all needed steps
                            automatically, no more interaction needed.
                            This one uses following targets:
                              1) paranut_core
                              2) build_system
                              3) run
                            Just make sure to connect the board, as it
                            will be programmed right after hardware and
                            software are built.
