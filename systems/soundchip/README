Development environment: Xilinx Vivado 2019.1


Target Boards:
  * Digilent Zybo board (Zynq Z-7010, XC7Z010)

  Note: Vivado Board Files must be installed!
    Ensure you have installed the Vivado Board Files for your target
    board. These files can be obtained from Digilent (they call it
    "Board Definitions") and are placed in the Vivado installation
    directory at '%Vivado-Dir/data/boards/board_files/'.


Additional hardware (for the final system):
  * headphones/speakers (ideally with adjustable volume)
  * OpenOCD compatible JTAG debugger (see doc/paranut-manual.pdf)


Description:
  The SoundChip lab exercise system provides a System-on-Chip, which
  contains following modules:
    * sound_chip_debug: this module containins all fixed modules. This
      part is provided as a pre-synthesized design chek point.
      The modules encapsulated within the debug module are ...
        * the ParaNut processor
        * an I2S interface module (feeding the Zybo's SSM2603 audio chip)
        * a core debug sub-system (PS based), for core debug and firmware
          functionality.
    * sound_core : space for a custom designed sound core (to be
      implemented by course participants / students).

  With the Makefile in the 'debug_shell/' directory, following parts are
  populated into the specified (PREFIX) installation directory:
    * sound_chip_system.vhd : system top level module which integrates ...
        * the sound_chip_debug module (sound_chip_debug.dcp, see below);
        * the sound_module (must be provided by the user, see above).
    * sound_chip_debug.dcp : sound_chip_debug submodule, as a synthesized
                             design check point (built by 'make build').
    * sound_chip_debug.hdf : sound_chip_debug hardware description file
                             (also generated by 'make build').
    * zybo-paranut_soundchip.xdc : Zybo board hardware constraint file.
    * firmware.elf : ParaNut firmware (generated by 'make build').
  For more information, please refer to the lecture units and the lab
  exercise description.



****************
* Make Targets *
****************

  Following make targets help to build and install the debug shell:

  * build:              Generate needed files as lined out in the
                        'Description' section.

  * install:            Install the system files to the installation
                        directory (to be specified by PREFIX).

  * clean / veryclean:  Clean up all generated files.
