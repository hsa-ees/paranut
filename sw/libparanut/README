Welcome!
========

Welcome the libparanut, a hardware abstraction layer that strives to make programming the ParaNut easy peasy lemon squeezy. Check the documentation on how to use this library in your application. A practical example can also be found in the libparanut_unittest directory.
> cd ../libparanut_unittest

libparanut - How to get Documentation
=====================================

The libparanut already has some documentation created and ready for you in the doc directory of your ParaNut repository. The libparanut_manual.pdf contains information relevant to the application developer. libparanut_manual_internal.pdf contains information for developers who want/need to program the libparanut itself.

You changed some documentation and need to update it? Or want to have a cool clickable html version of the documentation? The following part is for you, then.

First you will need to install Doxygen and move into the libparanut directory (which is the directory this README is in).

Create normal documentation:
> doxygen Documentation/Doxyfile

Create internal documentation:
> doxygen Documentation/Doxyfile_internal

The created documentation can then be found in the ./Documentation/html and
./Documentation/latex directories. The html version can be accessed by opening one of the html files in your browser of choice. For creating a pdf out of the latex version, Doxygen automatically generates a Makefile which you can use. Do the following:
> cd Documentation/latex
> make clean all

The full pdf is created in the same directory under the name refman.pdf. Don't forget to create both versions, copy them to the doc directory of the ParaNut repository and rename them properly.
