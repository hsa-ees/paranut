Welcome the libparanut Unittest, which is a Unittest for the libparanut. Information on the test subject can be found in the directory of the libparanut itself, which should be here:

libparanut Unittest - How to get Documentation
==============================================

The file libparanut_unittest_documentation.pdf contains the documentation for the libparanut Unittest. It also contains information for how to run this program.

You changed some documentation and need to update it? Or want to have a cool clickable html version of the documentation? The following part is for you, then.

First you will need to install Doxygen and move into the libparanut_unittest directory (which is the directory this README is in).

Create Documentation:
> doxygen Documentation/Doxyfile

The created documentation can then be found in the ./Documentation/html and
./Documentation/latex directories. The html version can be accessed by opening one of the html files in your browser of choice. For creating a pdf out of the latex version, Doxygen automatically generates a Makefile which you can use. Do the following:
> cd Documentation/latex
> make clean all

The full pdf is created in the same directory under the name refman.pdf. Don't forget to copy it to the libparanut_unittest directory and rename it properly.
