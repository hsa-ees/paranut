Run the Linux Kernel on the ParaNut.

Run make in this folder to build a pre-configured binary consisting of
a Linux Kernel, the OpenSBI bootloader and a device tree.

Note that either PARANUT_TOOLS must be set to the tools folder or
PN_EXTERNAL must point to the external folder.

Steps performed by the Makefile:
- Download and unpack compiler toolchain

- Download linux kernel and checkout specific version
- Install linux config
- Build linux kernel

- Update device tree by using the ParaNut config (memory address and size, mtimer address and frequency)
- Build device tree using linux dtc (scripts/dtc/dtc)

- Download correct version of OpenSBI
- Build OpenSBI payload image with linux kernel and device tree

The simulation can then be started by running make sim.
Note that the following ParaNut configuration options have to be set:
- CFG_PRIV_LEVELS=3
- CFG_EXU_M_EXTENSION=1
- CFG_EXU_A_EXTENSION=1

See systems/linux for a hardware refdesign.
