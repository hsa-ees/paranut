# Summary

This programm provides a way to test the UART16750 Hardware Module and uses the libuart library
The software can only be run on the FPGA Hardware and not in the simulator.

# Prerequisites

   - a zynq 7000 or zynq z7 7020 fpga board
   - a usb to uart adapter
   - picocom or a similar terminal programm
   - icsc and sv2v (for running the hls synthesis), which can be found here:
        - [ICSC](https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki/Getting-started)
        - [sv2v](https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v/releases/tag/v0.0.10)


# Setting the Baudrate

When setting the baudrate in the DLM and DLL registers it is important to note to do this [Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl16c750.pdf?ts=1673448438359&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FTL16C750) according to the Table for the 1.8 MHz crystal.

# Setup

To run this program the following steps need to be done:

1. Configure the CFG_UART_BASE_ENABLE attribute in the config.mk file in the root of the project and in the config.mk for the board being used to "true" to enable the UART module
2. Change the address of the UART module with the CFG_UART_BASE_ADDRESS attribute in the config.mk at the root of the project and in the config.mk file of the board being used.
    **Warning: When the Address the changed the UART  the HSL with ICSC needs to be rerun. For further informations read the README in /hw/sysc/uart**
3. Build the hardware in the system/refdesign folder with the external UART enabled. For information on how to enable the UART on the external PMOD read the README file in system/refdesign

4. Connect an UART adapter to the PMOD connector PE as follows:
![If no Picture is shown please open this file in doc-src/figs with the name uart_connections.jpeg](../../../doc-src/figs/uart_connection.jpeg)

5. When using  picocom open a connection with the following command:
```sh
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
It is possible that the device name of ttyUSB0 is not correct. Please change it to the device name of your USB to UART adapter
6. Run the software in the sw/lib_uart_api/libuart_example folder with the following command:
```sh
    make flash-refdesign-bit
```
